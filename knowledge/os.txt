An Operating System (OS) is system software that acts as an interface between computer hardware and users. It manages system resources such as the CPU, memory, storage, and input/output devices, ensuring efficient and secure operation. Without an operating system, application programs would not be able to function properly.

One of the primary responsibilities of an operating system is process management. A process is a program in execution, and the OS ensures that multiple processes share CPU time efficiently. Scheduling algorithms determine the order in which processes execute, balancing fairness, performance, and responsiveness.

Memory management is another critical function of an operating system. The OS allocates memory space to active processes and ensures that each program operates within its assigned boundaries. Techniques such as paging and segmentation improve memory utilization and system stability.

The operating system also handles file management. It organizes files into directories, controls access permissions, and ensures data integrity. This allows users and applications to store and retrieve information efficiently.

Device management enables communication between hardware components and software applications. The OS uses device drivers to control peripherals such as keyboards, printers, and storage devices, allowing seamless interaction with the system.

Modern operating systems support multitasking, enabling multiple applications to run concurrently. Through context switching, the OS rapidly alternates between tasks, creating the illusion of simultaneous execution.

Security and protection are essential OS responsibilities. The system enforces authentication, access control, and isolation to prevent unauthorized access and data corruption.

Operating systems are widely used in personal computers, servers, mobile devices, and embedded systems. Examples include Windows, Linux, and macOS, each designed to provide stable and efficient computing environments.

Understanding operating systems is fundamental to computer science because they form the backbone of all computing platforms. A well-designed OS improves performance, reliability, and user experience while enabling complex applications to run smoothly.
